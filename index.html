        <p>Welcome to my Blog! <br> I am super excited          to have you, I have dreamt about this day for           <br> years and I'm happy i finally get to share         my thoughts with the <br> world. <br> A little          bit about myself, I am 24, i am a feminist, I am         a medical <br> student and I am a yoga enthusias         t. I come from a big family, I have <br> 4              siblings and I live in Nigeria. I am from one of         the minority tribes <br> in Nigeria and I am the         middle child, the second girl, (talk about being         <br> invisible!)<br>I hope sharing some of my           experiences will help you find yourself or <br>         at least understand others.
        </p>

        <p>So the world has shutdown! Scary right?              Everything seems weird, what day is it even? Is         <br>there any purpose? Should I keep working out?           What's the purpose of it all? <br> To answer            these questions we have to start from the top.          What was the motivating factor for you? <br>Was it          the clothes you'll wear? or the way people will         accept you? <br> In order to keep up with good          habits, we have to find the motivation from             internal factors not external factors.<br> Everythin         g changes except you. At the end of the day,            you're all you've got, you're the one that's            left to deal with the you, you've created.<br> Do           you want that you to be a self-loathing and             validation seeking you? or do you want that you         to be a healthy satisfied you?</p>
